<br>
<br>
<p>mkdir day1: Creates a directory named day1.
   <p> cd day1/: Changes to the day1 directory.</p>
    touch fohtml.html: Creates an empty file called fohtml.html in the day1 directory.
   <p>cd ..: Goes back one directory level (up to the parent directory).</p> 
    <p>cd ../..: Goes back two directory levels.</p>
   <p>Double click on HTML file </p>

        <pre>
            The <pre> HTML element represents preformatted text, which is to be presented exactly as written in the
            HTML file. The text is typically rendered using a non-proportional, or monospaced font. Whitespace inside
            this element is displayed as written.</pre>
            <br>
The <br> <pre>HTML element produces a line break in text (also known as a carriage-return).
It is useful for writing where the division of lines is significant (e.g., a poem or address).</pre>
<hr>
The hr HTML element produces a thematic break in text (also known as a horizontal rule).</hr>
